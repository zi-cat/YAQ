Your Asshole Quotient

An analysis of the Am I The Asshole subreddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/).

In this project, I use natural language processing techniques in order to understand the linguistic characteristics that distinguish posts in which the author is identified as the Asshole (YTA) from those in which the author is deemed innocent of assholery (NTA).
